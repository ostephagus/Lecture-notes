\section{Defining Integration}
We are often introduced to integration as an inverse operation to differentiation. This is fine, if we know (or can guess) an antiderivative. However, this does not serve well as a definition when we can't. The idea is that the integral should be the area under a graph. We will consider the definite integral from $a$ to $b$ to be the signed area under the graph of $f(x)$. The problem with this, however, is to define such an area in terms of known concepts.
