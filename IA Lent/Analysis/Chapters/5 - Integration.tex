\section{Defining Integration}
We are often introduced to integration as an inverse operation to differentiation. This is fine, if we know (or can guess) an antiderivative. However, this does not serve well as a definition when we can't. The idea is that the integral should be the area under a graph. We will consider the definite integral from $a$ to $b$ to be the signed area under the graph of $f(x)$. The problem with this, however, is to define such an area in terms of known concepts.\par
We first assume that $f$ is a bounded, real-valued function over the closed interval $[a, b]$. That is,
$f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ and there exists some bound $K$ such that $|f(x)| \leq K$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$.
\begin{definition}{Dissection}
    A \underline{Dissection}, $\dissec$, of $[a, b]$ is a finite subset of $[a, b]$ containing the endpoints $a, b$. We write $\dissec = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n\}$ with $a = x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n < b$.
\end{definition}
Associated to such a dissection are the upper and lower sums given by:
\begin{equation}
    U(f, \dissec) = \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1}) \sup_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x)
    \label{eqnUpperSum}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    L(f, \dissec) = \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1}) \inf_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x)
    \label{eqnLowerSum}
\end{equation}
Note that the suprema and infinima are defined here, since $f$ is bounded.\par
Clearly we have that $L(f, \dissec) \leq U(f, \dissec)$.
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\dissec$ and $\dissec'$ are dissections. Suppose that $\dissec \subseteq \dissec'$. Then:
    \begin{equation*}
        L(f, \dissec) \leq L(f, \dissec') \leq U(f, \dissec') \leq U(f, \dissec)
    \end{equation*}
    \label{lemRefinement}
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}
    In this case, where $\dissec \leq \dissec'$, we say that $\dissec'$ is a \underline{refinement} of $\dissec$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\dissec = \{x_0, \cdots, x_n\}$. First consider $\dissec' = \dissec \cup \{y\}$, where $y \notin\dissec$.\par
    Then $y \in (x_{r - 1}, x_r)$ for some $r \in \{1, \cdots, n\}$.\par
    We must have that:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, y]} f(x), \sum_{x \in [y, x_r]} f(x) \leq \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, x_r]} f(x)
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore:
    \begin{align*}
        &(y - x_{r - 1}) \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, y]}f(x) + (x_r - y) \sup_{x \in [y, x_r]} f(x) \\
        &\leq (y - x_{r - 1}) \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, x_r]}f(x) + (x_r - y) \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, x_r]} f(x) \\
        &\leq (x_r - x_{r - 1}) \sup_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, x_r]}f(x) \\
    \end{align*}
    That is, $U(f, \dissec') \leq U(f, \dissec)$.\par
    Similarly, we know that:
    \begin{equation*}
        \inf_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, y]} f(x), \inf_{x \in [y, x_r]} f(x) \geq \inf_{x \in [x_{r - 1}, x_r]} f(x)
    \end{equation*}
    and we can use the above idea to show that:
    \begin{equation*}
        L(f, \dissec) \leq L(f, \dissec')
    \end{equation*}
    Further, if there exists more than one point in $\dissec' \backslash \dissec$, we can use the result iteratively and add each point one-by-one.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that $\dissec_1$ and $\dissec_2$ are two dissections. Then:
    \begin{equation*}
        L(f, \dissec_1) \leq U(f, \dissec_2)
    \end{equation*}
    \label{lemUpperSumAlwaysGreater}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Consider $\dissec = \dissec_1 \cup \dissec_2$. Then this is a refinement of both $\dissec_1$ and $\dissec_2$. Using lemma~\ref{lemRefinement}:
    \begin{equation*}
        L(f, \dissec_1) \leq L(f, \dissec) \leq U(f, \dissec) \leq U(f, \dissec_2)
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
We have also the trivial dissection, $\dissec_0 = \{a, b\}$.
\begin{align*}
    L(f, \dissec_0) &= (b - a) \inf_{x \in [a, b]} f(x) \geq -(b - a)K \\
    U(f, \dissec_0) &= (b - a) \sup_{x \in [a, b]} f(x) \leq (b - a)K
\end{align*}
So we have that:
\begin{align*}
    \subsetselect{U(f, \dissec)}{\dissec \text{ is a dissection}} \text{ is bounded above.}\\
    \subsetselect{L(f, \dissec)}{\dissec \text{ is a dissection}} \text{ is bounded below.}
\end{align*}
Note also that, by considering the trivial dissection, neither set is empty. We can therefore take a supremum and infinimum:
\begin{definition}{Upper integral}
    The \underline{upper integral} of $f$ is:
    \begin{equation*}
        I^*(f) = \inf_{\dissec\text{ in set of dissections}} U(f, \dissec)
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Lower integral}
    The \underline{lower integral} of $f$ is:
    \begin{equation*}
        I_*(f) = \sup_{\dissec\text{ in set of dissections}} L(f, \dissec)
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
Note that these are well-defined for any bounded function. We can also bound these in the following way by lemma~\ref{lemUpperSumAlwaysGreater}:
\begin{equation*}
    (b - a)\inf_{x \in [a, b]}f(x) \leq I_*(f) \leq I^*(f) \leq (b - a) \sup_{x \in [a, b]}f(x)
\end{equation*}
\begin{definition}{Integrable function}
    A bounded function $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ is \underline{Riemann integrable}, or just\\\underline{integrable}, if the lower integral of $f$ is equal to the upper integral of $f$. In this case, we define the integral to be this common limit:
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^b f(x) dx = I_*(f) = I^*(f)
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\section{Examples of Integrable Functions}
\begin{example}
    For ease, define $\dissec_k = \{0, \frac{1}{k}, \frac{2}{k}, \cdots, 1\}$, the uniform dissection.
    $f : [0, 1] \mapsto \R, f(x) = x$.
    Then consider $U(f, \dissec_k)$:
    \begin{align*}
        U(f, \dissec_k) &= \sum_{j = 1}^k \left(\frac{j}{j} - \frac{j - 1}{k}\right) \sup_{x \in [\frac{j - 1}{k}, \frac{j}{k}]} f(x) \\
        &= \sum_{j = 1}^k \frac{1}{k} \frac{j}{k} \\
        &= \frac{1}{k^2} \frac{1}{2} k(k + 1) \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2k}
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, the lower sum is:
    \begin{equation*}
        L(f, \dissec_k) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}
    \end{equation*}
    We deduce that the upper integral is bounded above by the infinimum over $k$ of the upper sums. This is $\frac{1}{2}$. Further, the lower integral is bounded below by the supremum over $k$ of the lower sum. This is $\frac{1}{2}$. Now, by the inequalities already established, the upper and lower integrals must both be $\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    Consider now the function:
    \begin{align*}
        f : [0, 1] &\mapsto \R \\
        x &\mapsto
        \begin{cases}
            1 & x \in \Q \\
            0 & x \notin \Q 
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    $f$ is not integrable. For any $\dissec$, every upper sum gives $1$ (there is always a rational number between any two real numbers), and every lower sum gives $0$ (there is always an irrational number between two real numbers). Therefore, $I^* = 1$ and $I_* = 0$.
\end{example}
\section{Integrability of General Functions}
\begin{theorem}[Riemann's Integrability Criterion]
    A bounded function $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ is integrable if and only if for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a dissection $\dissec$ such that:
    \begin{equation*}
        U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) < \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
    \label{thmRiemannCriterion}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{proofdirection}{$\Rightarrow$}{Assume that there exist $U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) < \epsilon$}
        For any dissection $\dissec$, we have that:
        \begin{equation*}
            0 \leq I^*(f) - I_*(f) \leq U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec)
        \end{equation*}
        Now we have the following bound:
        \begin{equation*}
            0 \leq I^*(f) - I_*(f) < \epsilon
        \end{equation*}
        And since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we must have that $I^*(f) = I_*(f)$, and $f$ is integrable.
    \end{proofdirection}
    \begin{proofdirection}{$\Leftarrow$}{Assume that $f$ is integrable.}
        Then for any $\epsilon$, there exist $\dissec_1, \dissec_2$ such that:
        \begin{align*}
            U(f, \dissec_1) &\leq I^*(f) + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
            L(f, \dissec_2) &\geq I_*(f) - \frac{\epsilon}{2}
        \end{align*}
        Therefore consider $\dissec = \dissec_1 \cup \dissec_2$. Therefore, by lemma~\ref{lemRefinement}
        \begin{align*}
            U(f, \dissec) &\leq U(f, \dissec_1) \\
            L(f, \dissec) &\geq L(f, \dissec_2)
        \end{align*}
        Which implies:
        \begin{align*}
            0 \leq U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) &\leq U(f, \dissec_1) - L(f, \dissec_2) \\
            &\leq I^*(f) - I_*(f) + \epsilon \\
            &= \epsilon
        \end{align*}
    \end{proofdirection}
\end{proof}
We can use this criterion to show that all monotone and all continuous functions are integrable.

\begin{remark}
    If $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ is monotone then it is bounded by its values at the endpoints. If $f$ is continuous, we can use theorem~\ref{thmExtremeValue} to show that it also is bounded.
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ is monotone. Then $f$ is integrable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    If $f$ is decreasing, re-label $-f$ to be $f$. Therefore assume WLOG that $f$ is increasing.
    
    For any given dissection $\dissec$,
    \begin{align*}
        \sup_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) &= f(x_j) \\
        \inf_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) &= f(x_{j-1}) 
    \end{align*}
    Therefore:
    \begin{align*}
        U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) &= \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1}) \sup_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) \\
        &- \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1}) \inf_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) \\
        &= \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1}) \left[f(x_j) - f(x_{j - 1})\right]
    \end{align*}
    Then choose the uniform dissection $\dissec_n$ into $n$ equal-length intervals. This gives:
    \begin{align*}
        U(f, &\dissec_n) - L(f, \dissec_n) \\
        &= \sum_{j = 1}^n \left(\frac{b - a}{n}\right) \left[f\left(a + \frac{j(b - a)}{n}\right) - f\left(a + \frac{(j - 1)(b - a)}{n}\right)\right] \\
        &= \frac{b - a}{n} \left[f(b) - f(a)\right] \text{ by telescoping series}
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, taking $n$ sufficiently large we have that this difference can be smaller than any given $\epsilon$. Therefore, by theorem~\ref{thmRiemannCriterion}, $f$ is integrable.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ is continuous. Then $f$ is integrable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We prove the contrapositive. That is, if $f$ is not integrable then it must be discontinuous.

    Suppose $f$ is not integrable. Therefore, by theorem~\ref{thmRiemannCriterion}, there must exist some $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that for any dissection $\dissec$, we have that:
    \begin{equation*}
        U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) > \epsilon_0
    \end{equation*}
    We also know that
    \begin{equation*}
        U(f, \dissec) - L(f, \dissec) = \sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - x_{j - 1})\left[\sup_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) - \inf_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x)\right]
    \end{equation*}
    It therefore follows that for any dissection there exists a $j$ with:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sup_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) - \inf_{x \in [x_{j-1}, x_j]} f(x) > \frac{\epsilon_0}{b - a}
    \end{equation*}
    since otherwise the sum cannot be greater than $\epsilon_0$.

    Now let $\dissec_n$ be the uniform dissection of $n$ equal-length intervals. And therefore we have a sub-interval with:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sup_{x \in [a + (j-1)(b-a)/n, a + j(b-1)/n]} f(x) - \inf_{x \in [a + (j-1)(b-a)/n, a + j(b-1)/n]} < \frac{\epsilon_0}{b - a}
    \end{equation*}
    And we deduce that there exist $y_n, z_n$ in the same interval (which gives $|y_n - z_n| \leq \frac{b - a}{n}$) such that:
    \begin{equation}
        f(y_n) - f(z_n) > \frac{\epsilon_0}{b - a}
        \label{eqnFOfSequenceFarApart}
    \end{equation}
    Note also that $(y_n)$ is a bounded sequence and by theorem~\ref{thmBolzanoWeierstrass}, we can extract a convergent subsequence $y_{n_k} \to \eta$ for $\eta \in [a, b]$.

    However, we also know that $|y_{n_k} - z_{n_k}| \leq \frac{b-a}{n_k} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, so we must also have that $z_{n_k} \to \eta$. However, the bound in equation~\ref{eqnFOfSequenceFarApart} implies that $f(y_n)$ and $f(z_n)$ do not tend to the same limit. Thus, by theorem~\ref{thmContinuitySequenceDef}, $f$ must be discontinuous at $\eta$.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    With monotone and continuous functions, we have that a large class of functions are integrable. However, there do exist functions outside these classes that are integrable.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}[Thamae's Function]
    Define:
    \begin{align*}
        f : [0, 1] &\mapsto \R \\
        x &\mapsto
        \begin{cases}
            \frac{1}{q} & x = \frac{p}{q} \text{ where } p, q \text{ coprime} \\
            0 & x \notin \Q
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Then we show that $f$ is integrable. Clearly for any $\dissec, L(f, \dissec) = 0$, so it is sufficient to show that we can find a $\dissec$ with $U(f, \dissec) < \epsilon$.

    Given $\epsilon > 0$, choose $N \in \N$ such that $\frac{1}{N} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Consider:
    \begin{equation*}
        P = \subsetselect{x \in [0, 1]}{f(x) \geq \frac{1}{N}} \subseteq \subsetselect{\frac{p, q}}{1 \leq p, q \leq N}
    \end{equation*}
    Then this is a finite set. Define $P = \{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_m\}$ and order the $p_i$ to be increasing with $i$. Then choose a dissection $\dissec$ that satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Each $p_k$ is in some interval $(x_{j - 1}, x_j)$.
        \item For each $k$, the unique sub-interval containing $p_k$ has length at most $\frac{\epsilon}{2m}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\end{document}
