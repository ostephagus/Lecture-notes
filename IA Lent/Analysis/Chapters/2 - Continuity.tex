\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}{Continuity at a point}
    Suppose that $E$ is a non-empty subset of the complex numbers. Let $f: E \mapsto \C$ be any function.\par
    Then $f$ is \underline{continuous at the point} $a \in E$ if, given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta(\epsilon) > 0$ such that:
    \begin{equation}
        |z - a| < \delta \implies |f(z) - f(a)| < \epsilon
        \label{eqnContinuityDefinition}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
Equation~\ref{eqnContinuityDefinition} roughly says that points close together in the domain are mapped onto points that are close together in the image.
\begin{definition}{Continuity on a set}
    A function $f$ as defined above is \underline{continuous on the set} $E$ if $f$ is continuous at every point in $E$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Sequential characterisation of continuity]
    A function $f : E \mapsto \C$ is continuous at $a \in E$ if and only if $f(z_n) \to f(a)$ for all sequences $z_n$ where $z_n \to a$, and each point $z_n \in E$.
    \label{thmContinuitySequenceDef}
\end{theorem}
Informally, this says that a function is convergent if it commutes with sequence limits:
\begin{equation}
    f(\lim_{n \to \infty}z_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty}f(z_n)
    \label{eqnLimitCommutativity}
\end{equation}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{proofdirection}{$\Rightarrow$}{Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a$}
        Let $z_n$ be a sequence satisfying the required properties. Let $\epsilon > 0$, then there exists $\delta(\epsilon) > 0$ such that if $z \in E$,
        \begin{equation*}
            |z - a| < \delta \implies |f(z) - f(a)| < \epsilon
        \end{equation*}
        But since $z_n \to a$, there exists $N(\delta)$ such that:
        \begin{align*}
            n \geq N &\implies |z_n - a| < \delta \\
            &\implies |f(z_n) - f(a)| < \epsilon
        \end{align*}
    \end{proofdirection}
    \begin{proofdirection}{$\Leftarrow$}{Suppose, on the contrary, that $f$ is not continuous at $a$.}
        Therefore there exists some number $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that for all $\delta(\epsilon_0)$ there exists a $z \in E$ with $|z - a| < \delta$ and $|f(z) - f(a)| \geq \epsilon_0$.\par
        Then consider this with $\delta = 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1, 3}, \cdots, \frac{1}{n}, \cdots$. Then for each $n$ there exists a $z_n$ with $|z_n - a| < \frac{1}{n}$ and:
        \begin{equation*}
            |f(z_n) - f(a)| \geq \epsilon_0
        \end{equation*}
        Then $z_n \to a$ but $f(z_n) \not\to f(a)$.
    \end{proofdirection}
\end{proof}
This is very useful. We can get lots of extra results about convergence with little extra work.
\begin{propositions}{
        Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are functions $E \mapsto \C$, and are continuous at a point $a \in E$. Then the following are continuous at $a$:
        \label{propsContinuityProperties}
    }
    \item $f(z) + g(z)$ \label{propSumContinuity}
    \item $f(z)g(z)$ \label{propProductContinuity}
    \item $\lambda f(z)$ for complex coefficient $\lambda$ \label{propScalingContinuity}
    \item $\frac{1}{f(z)}$ as long as $f(z)$ non-zero \label{propReciprocalContinuity}
\end{propositions}
\begin{proof}
    All proofs by proposition~\ref{propsSequenceFacts} and theorem~\ref{thmContinuitySequenceDef}
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Composition of continuous functions]
    Consider two subsets $A$ and $B$ of the complex numbers. Let $f : A \mapsto B$, and $g : B \mapsto \C$.\par
    Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $a \in A$, and $g$ is continuous at $f(a) \in B$. Then the composition $g \circ f$ is continuous at $a$.
    \label{thmCompositionContinuous}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $z_n$ is any sequence with $z_n \in A$, and $z_n \to a$. Then for each $n$, $f(z_n) \in B$, and $f(z_n) \to f(a)$ by continuity of $f$. Therefore this is a sequence in $B$ converging to $f(a)$ and so by the continuity of $g$, the sequence $g(f(z_n))$ must converge to $g(f(a))$.\par
    Now we have that any sequence $z_n$ in $A$ converges to $g(f(a))$ in $\C$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{examples}{\label{exContinuityExamples}}
    \item $f(z) = z$ is continuous at all $z \in \C$.
    \item Any polynomial is continuous at any point by the above example and proposition~\ref{propsContinuityProperties}.
    \item $f(z) = |z|$ is continuous at all points (consider the estimate \\ $\big ||z| - |w|\big | \leq |z - w|$)
    \item The function $f(x) = 0$ if $x \leq 0$, and $f(x) = 1$ if $x > 0$, is not continuous at $x = 0$. \label{exStepDiscontinuity}
    \item Consider $f : \R \mapsto \R$:
        \begin{equation*}
            f(x) =
            \begin{cases}
                \sin{(1/x)} & x \neq 0 \\
                0 & x = 0
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        Assume that $\sin$ is continuous everywhere, so if $x \neq 0$ then proposition~\ref{propReciprocalContinuity} gives that $f$ is continuous for non-zero $x$. However, $f$ is discontinuous at $x = 0$. To see this, let $x_n = \frac{1}{(2n + 1/2)\pi}$. Then for all $n$, $f(x_n) = 1$, but $x_n \to 0$ and $f(0) = 0$.
        \label{exSinOneOverXDiscontinuity}
    \item Consider a similar function $f : \R \mapsto \R$:
        \begin{equation*}
            f(x) = 
            \begin{cases}
                x \sin{(1/x)} & x \neq 0 \\
                0 & x = 0
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        We show that this function is, in fact, continuous. Consider any sequence $x_n \to 0$. Estimate $|f(x_n)| = |x_n| |\sin{(1/x_n)}| \leq |x_n|$. Note that this does not hold for $x_n = 0$, but no matter since we define $f(0) = 0$. Therefore the sequence converges by theorem~\ref{thmContinuitySequenceDef}
        \label{exXSinOneOverXContinuity}
    \item Consider the Dirichlet Function $f : \R \mapsto \R$:
        \begin{equation*}
            f(x) = 
            \begin{cases}
                1 & x \in \Q \\
                0 & x \notin \Q
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        Then this function is discontinuous at every point. If $x$ is irrational, then we consider the sequence of finite decimal expansions $x_n$ that converges to $x$. However, $f(x_n) = 1$, and $f(x) = 0$. Similarly, if $x$ is rational, then take any sequence of irrational numbers converging to $x$. \label{exDirichletDiscontinuity}
\end{examples}
Example \ref{exStepDiscontinuity} is the classic discontinuous function, but discontinuous functions can be more complex, as shown in example \ref{exSinOneOverXDiscontinuity}. We can also have continuous functions that are not very ``well-behaved'', as shown in example~\ref{exXSinOneOverXContinuity}
\section{Limit of a Function}
Suppose that $f : E \mapsto \C$. Then we want to define what we mean by
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{z \to a} f(x)
\end{equation*}
even if $a \notin E$.\par
For example, we would like to define $\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{\sin{z}}{z}$.\par
This concept does not always make sense. For example, if a function is defined on the interval $[1, 2]$ and at the point $0$, it does not really make sense to consider $\lim_{x \to 1/2}f(x)$ because there are no points nearby, nor does it make sense to consider $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x)$, by the same logic.
\begin{definition}{Limit point}
    Suppose that $E \subseteq \C$ and $a \in \C$. Then $a$ is a \underline{limit point} of $E$ if, for any $\delta > 0$, there exists some $z \in E$ such that:
    \begin{equation*}
        0 < |z - a| < \delta
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
Intuitively, this requires that there be a point of $E$ inside any size disc around $a$. If $a$ belongs to $E$ but is not a limit point, it is an \underline{isolated point}.
\begin{remark}
    $a$ is a limit point of $E$ if and only if there exists a sequence $(z_n)$ such that $z_n \in E$, $z_n \neq a$, but $z_n \to a$.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}{Limit}
    Suppose that $f: E \subseteq C \mapsto \C$. Let $a$ be a limit point of $E$. Then $l$ is the \underline{limit} as $z \to a$ of $f(a)$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{z \to a} f(z) = l
    \end{equation*}
    if for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that for all $z \in E$ which lie within $\delta$ of $a$ ($0 < |z - a| < \delta$), we have that:
    \begin{equation*}
        |f(z) - l| < \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
We also have an equivalent definition in terms of sequences:
\begin{lemma}
    If $f, E$ and $a$ are as above, then $\lim_{z \to a} f(x) = l$ if and only if $f(z_n) \to l$ for all sequences $z_n \in E$, $z_n \neq a$ and $z_n \to a$.
    \label{lemLimitSequenceDef}
\end{lemma}
The proof is almost identical to that of theorem~\ref{thmContinuitySequenceDef}.\par
\begin{remark}
    Combining the sequence definitions of continuity and of the limit, if $a \in E$ and is a limit point of $E \backslash \{a\}$, then $f$ is continuous if and only if $\lim_{z \to a} f(z) = f(a)$. Also, if $a$ is an isolated point, then continuity is immediate (and also not very useful).
\end{remark}
\begin{propositions}{
        Let $f$, $a$, $E$ be defined as above Let $g$ also be a function $E \mapsto \C$.
        \label{propsLimitProperties}
    }
    \item The limit of a function at any point is unique, or not defined. \label{propLimitUnique}
    \item $\lim_{z \to a} (f(z) + g(z)) = \lim_{z \to a}(f(z)) + \lim_{z \to a} (g(z))$ \label{propLimitSum}
    \item $\lim_{z \to a} (f(z) \times g(z)) = \lim_{z \to a}(f(z)) \times \lim_{z \to a} (g(z))$ \label{propLimitProduct}
    \item If $g(z)$ is non-zero and the limit is non-zero, then:
        \begin{equation*}
            \lim_{z \to a} \frac{f(z)}{g(z)} = \frac{\lim_{z \to a} f(z)}{\lim_{z \to a} g(z)}
        \end{equation*}
\end{propositions}
\section{The Intermediate Value Theorem}
The Intermediate Value Theorem informally captures the idea that if $f$ is continuous, it can be sketched without lifting the pen from the page.
\begin{theorem}[Intermediate value theorem]
    Suppose that $f : [a, b] \mapsto \R$ and is continuous on the whole interval. Without loss of generality, let $f(a) < f(b)$. Then for any $\eta$ with $f(a) < \eta < f(b)$, there exists at least one value $c$ with $a \leq c \leq b$ where $\eta = f(c)$.
\end{theorem}
This theorem is aided by figure~\ref{figIntermediateValue}
