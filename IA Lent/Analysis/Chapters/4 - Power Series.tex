We want to consider functions defined by power series of the form:
\begin{equation}
    f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (z - z_0)^n
\end{equation}
Where $a_n$, $z$ and $z_0$ are complex numbers. By translation, we can assume $z_0 = 0$.
\section{Convergence of power series}
This series may not converge for all $z \in \C$. The first task, therefore, is to understand the set of points for which a function of this form converges.
\begin{lemma}
    If a power series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ converges, and $|w| < |z|$, then the power series:
    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n w^n
    \end{equation*}
    converges absolutely.
    \label{lemConvergenceRegionIsDisc}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n$ converges, $a_n z^n \to 0$.\par
    Therefore $\exists K > 0$ such that $|a_n z^n| \leq K$ for all $n$.\par
    Now consider, for $w \neq 0$ (note that the case $w = 0$ is trivial),
    \begin{align*}
        |a_n w^n| &= |a_n z^n| \left|\frac{w}{z}\right| \\
        &\leq K\rho^n
    \end{align*}
    where $\rho = \frac{|w|}{|z|}$, and is less than $1$ by assumption. Therefore, by the comparison to the sum $\sum_{n=0}^\infty K\rho^n$, the required power series converges.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    We will use this result to show that every power series has a well-defined radius of convergence.
\end{remark}
