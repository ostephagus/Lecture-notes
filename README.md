# Cambridge University Maths Lecture notes

Taken by Sam Glover

## Structure

Each term has its own folder at the root of the repo, and then each course has a folder inside that. Inside a course folder there are the Main.tex file, optionally some images, and the Chapters/ folder that contains all the chapters subfiles.

## Compiling

The individual Main.tex files need their entire folder (Chapters/ and any other files like images), as well as Header.tex and the lecturenotes package - see [the github repository](https://www.github.com/ostephagus/lecturenotes)

## Website

The plan is to upload these notes to www.srcf.net at some point.
